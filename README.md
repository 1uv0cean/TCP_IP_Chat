## 👨🏻‍💻 Overview  
    The use of the transport system by the weak should be guaranteed by rights, not welfare.  
As time goes by, the number of vulnerable people is increasing, but people's perceptions and systems are not improving. The low-floor bus system is designed and operated for the weak in transportation, but the disabled person and weak people are not comfortably using the bus.  
The low-floor bus reservation system currently in place allows reservations by phone or text, but such services are not available to the weak with language and speech impairments.  
To compensate for these inconveniences, our team planned a simple and intuitive low-floor bus reservation system using the application.


<br/>

## ✈️ TO BE
Protecting the use of public transportation by the disadvantaged with rights, not welfare, want to tear down the <b>"Barrier"</b> in front of the weak to <b>"Free"</b>. The use of the application makes it easy for the underprivileged to book low-floor buses and allows bus drivers to check their booking information intuitively and unhindered. Furthermore, we strive to improve awareness of the underprivileged and create an equal world.
